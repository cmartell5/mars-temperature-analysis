# web-scraping-project
Web scraping using Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.

## Part 1
I parsed the [Mars News](https://redplanetscience.com/) website by using Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I then scraped the titles and preview texts of the 20 most recent Mars news articles and converted them into a Python data structure. The data is then stored into MongoDB.

## Part 2
The data was retrieved from the [Mars Temperature Data](https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html) site and the data was stored into a pandas DataFrame.  
After that, I answered the following questions with related visualizations using Pandas:
 * How many months exist on Mars?
 * How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
 * What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
 * Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
 * About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? (using a visual estimate)
